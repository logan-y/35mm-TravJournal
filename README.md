# 35mm-TravJournal
My Bright Paths capstone project - A travel journal where users can post details about their recent trips and the film used to document those trips.

## User is able to:

- create a new post, and populate it with data regarding the type of film used, the location visited, and notes about their trip.
- delete posts
- filter posts by keyword, location, or film type.


## Database contains:

- Film brand, type, and speed rating
- User entries - notes, creation date, film details (FK), address (FK)
- Travel address - state & city
